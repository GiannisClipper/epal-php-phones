Simple phone catalogue based on PHP lessons taken in vocational senior high school (1ο Εσπερινό ΕΠΑΛ Ταύρου). The program stores a Person's name and a Phone number for each record in a database table (MySQL). The user can Create new record, Read all existing records, Update or Delete each of them and also is checked and blocked from saving dublicate or empty values. Live demo is available here https://epal-php-phones.000webhostapp.com/ where each record automatically deleted one hour after created or last updated.
